# Character-Level-Language-Model
This mini model is simply built using Python `Numpy`

I shared the python `.ipynb` file in this repo along with the explanation of major steps in training as well as testing.

# Training
I trained thid model to learn the phrase: *Twinkle Twinkle little star, how i wonder what you are, up above the worlds so high, like a diamond in teh sky.*
